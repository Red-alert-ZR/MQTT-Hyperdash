The windows version is still in a very experimental state. Help needed!


1. The WINDOWS version had a problem with TrueType fonts. It should work now, but is not heavily tested. Fallback 8x8 font seems OK.
2. gtk was completely deactivated.
3. From the .zip file distribution all .dll files need to be in the same directory as the .exe files. 

5. commandline processing is not working correctly. Single letters??? (Unicode?)

* Rule-Engines seem to work.
* Basic graphics and mouse control seem to work.
* Connections to MQTT broker seem to work.
