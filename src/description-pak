universal MQTT dashboard and rule machinery.

This is a fast and efficient dashboard (GUI) for the MQTT framework. It uses
the SDL library for graphics rendering, the paho library for communication and
the gtk2 framework for user input. The dashboard runs on linux, 
but a port to other operating systems should be easy.
