Summary     : A MQTT Dashbord
Description :

This is a fast and efficient dashboard (GUI) for the MQTT framework. It ises
the  SDL library for graphics rendering. Exept for the paho library no other
special library is needed. The dashbord runs on linux, but a port to other
operating systems should be easy. 

There are two applications included: 

hyperdash runs a panel/dashboard, which has been defined in a dash file. 

hyperdash-designer is a graphical tool to create the dash files. However 
this program is still stub and the dash files must be created and edited by 
a text editor by hand. However we also think of automatically create dash files 
from topic lists so one has a good starting point to work with. 

hyperdash-autocreate will do this job. 



The Project is still in alpha phase. Please see the CONTRIBUTING.md how you can
