MQTT-Hyperdash V.1.00
=====================

MQTT, the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport protocol is specially designed to
handle high bandwidth and low latency data transport and machine communication
for the Internet of Things (IoT). However, also the Graphicsl User Interfaces 
for the Internet of Things  should refelct this and must not be a performace
bottleneck. MQTT-Hyperdash tries to fullfill this.

The man machine interface MQTT Hyperdash is the interactive tool from which the
individual components of the IoT are controlled. In order to avoid
confusion and to minimize the learning time, the interface builds on ergonomic
and logical concepts which allow for an intuitive understanding of its
operation and of the operation of the devices it controls.

Virtual control panels (dashbords) allow users to operate on the graphical
representations of a large set of devices like switches, knobs, sliders, digital
and analog indicators, whose behaviour is equivalent to that of the real
instrumental devices.  

The connection with the MQTT brokers on the lower layers is automatic and
completely transparent. This way the implementation of a Cockpit for an 
any-scale complicated machine consisting of many (thousands of) devices can
be realized. Technically this has been possible for a long time, but 
standardization was missing, until now!
