MQTT Hyperdash V.1.00
=====================



The MQTT is specially designed for high  bandwidth an machine data transpet for
the Internet of Things (IoT)  on all layers and, due to envisaged future
upgrades and expansions,  seamless extension in capacity and capability. 

The man machine interface MQTT Hyperdash is the interactive tool from which the
individual components of the IoT are controlled. In order to avoid
confusion and to minimize the learning time, the interface builds on ergonomic
and logical concepts which allow for an intuitive understanding of its
operation and of the operation of the devices it controls.

Virtual control panels (dashbords) allow users to operate on the graphical
representations of a large set of devices like switches, knobs, sliders, digital
and analog indicators, whose behaviour is equivalent to that of the real
instrumental devices.  

The connection with the MQTT brokers on the lower layers is automatic and
completely transparent.
